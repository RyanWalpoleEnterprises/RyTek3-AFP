# RyTek3
## Application Framework Patch

<img src="https://ryanwalpole.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Picture1.png"/>

 The RyTek3 application framework reached end of life support in January 2017, however many applications were built on this framework that are closed source and have not been updated since. In 2020, apps on Windows 10 running the RyTek3 framework stopped working due to an issue caused by updates made to Windows. This application framework patch is designed to fix that issue and allow those broken applications to still function.

 ### Important!
 The RyTek3 platform was discontinued in 2017 with the last security patches being released by Ryan Walpole Enterprises in 2018. Software that uses the RyTek3 framework may be susceptible to malicious content and may not be secure to use. Please keep this in mind while using this framework patch.

### Use case scenario
- You use a program that takes advantage of the RyTek Framework that has not been updated in some time. This software is important to your workflow and you need to use it.
- You are educating yourself on the RyTek framework for a hobbyist project.
 
## Getting Started

**Step One: Download the Patch** [[See Releases]](https://github.com/RyanWalpoleEnterprises/RyTek3-AFP/releases)
> The patch comes as a setup executable that can be downloaded from the "Releases" page on this GitHub repository.

**Step Two: Run the Setup Executable**
> The setup executable is an unsigned application. You may have trouble downloading and installing it based on Microsoft Smartscreen, Anti-Virus software or your browser. This application is safe to use. The reason it is unsigned is because RWE Softworks is a subsidiary that does not have funding and is for employees of Ryan Walpole Enterprises to release experimental software. If you are having trouble downloading or installing the setup executable, we have a support article available here.

**Step Three: Run the Patch Software**
> Once you have followed all of the prompts in the Setup Executable, you will have the option to launch the program on completion. If you did not tick this option, it should show up in your start menu unless you disabled it. The software can always be run using the "Run" application in Windows or via the Start Menu search box by providing the path:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\RWE\RyTek\AFP\afp.exe`

> Once you have opened the patch application, it is as simple as clicking the "Patch RyTek" button and waiting for the patch to complete.

**Step Four: Verify that the patch worked!**
> Try running your problem program. If it does not work, try running the patch process again. If it still doesn't work, the program may be broken from an unrelated change to Windows. If this is the case, other RyTek applications should still run. We are working at providing a test application for you to run to ensure the patch was successful.
